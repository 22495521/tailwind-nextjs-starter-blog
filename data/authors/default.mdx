嗨，我是詹益韶（Ethan Zhan），一名軟體工程師，也是一個熱愛學習和分享的人。工作上主要負責全端開發，後端熟悉 Node.js 和 TypeScript，前端框架與系統架構也有涉獵，偶爾會鑽研怎麼讓整體流程更順、更清楚。

這個網站是我記錄學習歷程的地方，分享技術筆記、開發過程、或是一些思考與心得。希望內容能對正在成長中的你有點幫助，也作為自己的軌跡留存。

除了寫程式，我從小學一年級開始學圍棋，目前是中華圍棋協會四段、野狐六段。這幾年曾在兒童圍棋機構與中小學任教，學生年齡從幼兒園到成人都有。圍棋是一種邏輯與耐性的訓練，也是一種陪伴孩子們學習、思考的方式。之後也會在這裡分享一些教學筆記與教材，若有興趣家教的朋友也歡迎透過信箱聯絡。

平常也喜歡健身，主要是重量訓練，習慣記錄每次訓練的進度與變化。健身是一種建立生活節奏與穩定的方式，也讓思緒更清晰。有時會分享一些訓練心得或飲食紀錄，還有關於自律與日常平衡的想法。

這裡同時會放一些讀書筆記和生活觀察，紀錄片段心情，也許偶爾能激發些靈感或共鳴。如果你想聊聊想法，或對圍棋家教有興趣，都可以寄信給我。

Hi, I'm Ethan Zhan — a software engineer who’s passionate about learning and sharing. I currently work as a full-stack developer, specializing in backend development with Node.js and TypeScript. I also explore frontend frameworks and system architecture, always aiming to make the development process more seamless and efficient.

This site is where I document my learning journey — sharing technical notes, development insights, and personal thoughts. I hope some of it resonates with you, especially if you're also growing and learning in the tech field.

Outside of coding, I've been playing Go since first grade. I currently hold a 4-dan rank from the Taiwan Go Association and 6-dan on Fox Go Server. Over the years, I’ve taught Go at children's institutions and schools, with students ranging from preschoolers to adults. I see Go as a great way to train logic and patience, and as a meaningful way to accompany others in their learning journey. I'll be sharing Go teaching materials and reflections here as well — feel free to reach out if you're interested in private lessons.

Fitness is another part of my life. I focus on strength training and enjoy tracking progress and change over time. It helps me maintain balance and clarity in my routine. Occasionally, I’ll share some thoughts on training, nutrition, discipline, and the idea of living with structure.

You’ll also find some reading notes, thoughts on life, and random reflections. Hopefully, something here sparks inspiration or simply keeps you company for a while. If you'd like to connect, or you're interested in Go lessons, feel free to drop me an email.
